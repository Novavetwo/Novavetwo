## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a trilogy of books. My perfectionism doesn't let me finish them, but I'm working on them to release the first one in the next 10 years.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to sing, program and rollerblade!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on otimization of codes, as that is the most interesting process on the programming subject, at least for me.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm looking forward to move from my country to Canada or the USA, so that I can be a movies director! I love to tell stories, and I'm very meticulous, so I think this would be a wonderful experience.
