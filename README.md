### 🔭 Currently Working On
A **trilogy of books** — I'm a perfectionist, so it's a long journey, but I plan to release the first one in the next 10 years.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- Programming (especially code **optimization** — it's what fascinates me the most!)
- How to rollerblade!

### 👯 Looking to Collaborate On
- Clean and optimized code projects
- Anything involving creative storytelling through tech

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I'm planning to move to **Canada or the USA** to become a programmer — and in the future, a **film director**!  
I love telling stories and I'm incredibly detail-oriented, so I believe filmmaking will be a perfect fit.
