## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a trilogy of books. My perfectionism makes it hard to finish them, but I'm aiming to release the first one within the next 10 years.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming and how to rollerblade!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on code optimization â€” itâ€™s the most fascinating part of programming to me.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m planning to move to Canada or the USA to work as a programmer and, eventually, become a film director! I love storytelling and Iâ€™m very detail-oriented, so I believe it would be an amazing journey.
