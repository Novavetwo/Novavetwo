### 🔭 Currently Working On
A **trilogy of books** — I’m currently working on a trilogy of books. My perfectionism makes it hard to finish them, but I'm aiming to release the first one within the next 10 years.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- Programming (especially code **optimization** — it fascinates me!)
- How to rollerblade!
- Storytelling — through words, sound, and images

### 👯 Looking to Collaborate On
- Clean and optimized code projects  
- Creative storytelling projects that blend technology and narrative

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I'm planning to move to **Canada or the USA** to work as a programmer — and eventually become a **film director**!  
I love telling stories and I'm incredibly detail-oriented, so I believe filmmaking will be a perfect fit.
